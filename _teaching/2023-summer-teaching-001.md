Assisted in the preparation of practical and experimental classes for the "Aircraft Structural Materials and Joints" course as part of the Master's program in Mechanical Engineering. Played a key role in manufacturing the specimens used in both the experimental sessions and the numerical tutorial lectures.

Moreover, developed the [SLJ Designer](https://vascopires.github.io/portfolio/SLJ_Designer/) application, an innovative tool designed to facilitate the generation of finite element models of single lap joints (SLJs). This application proved instrumental in enhancing the understanding of adhesive bonding concepts among students. Additionally, created comprehensive tutorials and guides to assist students in utilizing the SLJ Designer effectively.

The [SLJ Designer](https://vascopires.github.io/portfolio/SLJ_Designer/) application allowed students to engage in hands-on learning experiences and explore various material combinations and conditions. With 88.9% of students identifying the application as a "safe space" to learn more about finite element methods and adhesive bonding, its impact on student learning and development in these areas was substantial.
