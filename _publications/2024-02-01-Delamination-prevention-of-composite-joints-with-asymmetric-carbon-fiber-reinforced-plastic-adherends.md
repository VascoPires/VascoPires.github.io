**Abstract:**

The study proposes a novel concept of a curved single lap joint (SLJ) with non- uniform adhesive thickness to reduce stress concentrations near overlap edges. Experimental and numerical methodologies investigate this joint using two adhesives: Araldite 2015-1 and AV138. Numerical models in ABAQUS predict cohesive failure in the adhesive layer. The curved configuration doesnâ€™t significantly enhance strength in SLJ using ductile adhesives, but for brittle ones, strength increased by 131% due to sensitivity to peak stresses. In conclusion, the curved SLJ effectively reduces stress concentrations and the effectiveness of this concept is linked to the ductility of the adhesive used.
