**Abstract:**

This work consists on the description of the development process of several devices to prevent COVID-19 spread in common places such as door handlers and sanitizer dispensers. In order to obtain functional prototypes as fast as possible, the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process was used. The chosen material to print the devices was Polylactic acid (PLA), as well as other anti-bacterial polymers. The mechanical functioning of the devices was validated using numerical simulation with the finite element method. The solutions obtained proved to be efficient, functional, and to present a lower cost than already available solutions.
