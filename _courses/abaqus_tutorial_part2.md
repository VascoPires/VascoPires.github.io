## Coming soon

We’ll cover:
- Identifying symmetry planes and compatible loads/BCs
- Partitioning and meshing a symmetric slice
- Post-processing symmetry-aware results

Stay tuned. In the meantime, jump back to Part 1:
[Part 1: Setting a Quick Model]({{ '/courses/abaqus_plate_with_hole/' | relative_url }}).
