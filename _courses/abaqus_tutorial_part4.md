## Coming soon

Planned topics:
- Von Mises vs principal stresses near the hole
- XY data along a path and stress concentration factor
- Comparing coarse vs refined meshes

Head back to the starting point if needed:
[Part 1: Setting a Quick Model]({{ '/courses/abaqus_plate_with_hole/' | relative_url }}).
