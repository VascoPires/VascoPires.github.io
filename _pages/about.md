Hi! Welcome to my corner of the internet. My name is Vasco and I am currently doing my Ph.D. and working as a researcher at the [Institute of Designing Plastics and Composite Materials](https://www.kunststofftechnik.at/en/konstruieren) and lecturer at [MUL](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/). If you’re interested in my academic and engineering work, you’ll find plenty to explore in the navigation bar.

<!--
It is a fascinating area with a lot of challenges, and I hope my work, even in small ways, can contribute to advancements that make a difference — whether that's in exploring new planets, improving satellite surveillance, or reducing the weight and emissions of aircraft.
-->

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring, always looking for ways to make learning more engaging and interactive, especially through visualization and animations. This was the main reason for the creation of my YouTube channel, where I am planning to post content soon - so stay tuned for that. 

On the side, I enjoy writing about topics that excite me. My blog is where I share book reviews and personal lessons on various subjects, often focused on improving different areas of life. It’s a space where I reflect, learn, and connect with others who are on similar journeys.

Thanks for stopping by! If any of what I said resonated with you and want to hear more about me, feel free to sign up to my newsletter (my goal is to write something at least every week).
