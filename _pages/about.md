Hi! I am currently doing my Ph.D. and working as a researcher at the [Institute of Designing Plastics and Composite Materials](https://www.kunststofftechnik.at/en/konstruieren) and lecturer at [MUL](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/). Most of my work revolves around simulating composite materials, diving into how they behave and finding ways to improve them. It is a fascinating area with a lot of challenges, and I hope my work, even in small ways, can contribute to advancements that make a difference — whether that's in exploring new planets, improving satellite surveillance, or reducing the weight and emissions of aircraft.

I am passionate about teaching and mentoring, always looking for ways to make learning more engaging and interactive, especially through visualization techniques. This was the main reason for the creation of my YouTube channel, where I am planning to post content soon, so stay tuned for that. On the side, I enjoy doing 3D modeling, design, and even dabbling in a bit of machine learning whenever I get the chance.
