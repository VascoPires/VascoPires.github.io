Hi! I am currently doing my Ph.D. and working as a researcher at the [Institute of Designing Plastics and Composite Materials](https://www.kunststofftechnik.at/en/konstruieren) and lecturer at [MUL](https://www.unileoben.ac.at/en/). Most of my work revolves around simulating composite materials, diving into how they behave and finding ways to improve them. It is a fascinating area with a lot of challenges, and I hope my work, even in small ways, can contribute to advancements that make a difference — whether that's in exploring new planets, improving satellite surveillance, or reducing the weight and emissions of aircraft. It’s really rewarding to know that what I do could have such a broad impact.

I also am a lecturer, On the side, I also get into 3D modeling, design work, and a bit of machine learning when I can.
